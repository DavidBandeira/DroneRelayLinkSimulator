# DroneRelayLinkSimulator
This repository contains MATLAB code used to generate the simulations  on UAV-based communication relays. It provides a modular and flexible simulation framework for evaluating both backhaul 5G NR links and local Wi-Fi access, including trajectory planning, user distribution, link budget computation, and throughput estimation.
